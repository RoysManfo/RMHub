# RMHub
[@R0ysM](https://github.com/R0ysM)'s website.  
Enjoy apps, authomate your daily tasks, and more to come.

## Info
### What can I do in RMHub
Apart from admiring my great CSS and SCSS skills, you can download some apps that I made myself to make your day a little better:  
- authomating the openning of RMHub in your browser every day
- not having to struggle to create a password on your own using a password generator
- plaiyng some minigames on our website
  
Anyways in RMHub you can purchase some programs to support me and my work (if you are nice).

### How is RMHub built
The website has been built using HTML and Sass (with a Scss compiler)  
For the backend and the hosting I use Firebase Firestore and Firebase Hosting, and for statistical reasons I have enabled Google Analytics.
